### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was exciting  overwhelmed because i was starting a new language which i had not learned before.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more excited, encouraged and grateful for this chance which i believe is going to challege me as well as teach me a lot about working enviroment as a developer.

- I find the project to be (joyful / relaxing / exciting / it challenges me / difficult / I need something more challenging / ...)

- My level of stress is (relaxed / manageable / high)
